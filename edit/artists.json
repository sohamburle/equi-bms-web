The band started out as the solo project of bassist Riju Dasgupta (Workshop, Old Monks) who wanted to marry his love of literature with his other love: metal.\n\nLater on, a lineup of like-minded musicians was standardized and Albatross was born. The band released the critically acclaimed 'Dinner is You', a concept EP about cannibalism and the Kuru disease, which was mastered by Grammy nominated Swedish producer Andy LaRocque from King Diamond, in September 2010.\n\nIn 2012, Albatross released ‘The Kissing Flies’ EP as part of a split CD with American doom metal band Vestal Claret to critical acclaim. This EP features contributions from famed luminaries such as Niklas 'Viper' Stalvind (Wolf), The Demonstealer (Demonic Resurrection) and Murari Vasudevan (Rat King).\n\nAlbatross has supported legendary bands like Kreator and Wolf in the recent past and besides being a regular in the Indian live circuit did a successful three-city tour of Australia in 2013. Albatross is currently working on its first full-length album that is due for release soon. Get a taste of the same at http://transcendingobscurityindia.bandcamp.com/album/fear-from-the-skies.\n\nAnd while you're at it, be on the lookout for Albatross as the birds visit a town near you!\n\nPress Quotes:\n“Old-school metal sounds coupled with some awesome guitars, screechy growls and classy drumming — that is Albatross for you.”\n – Bangalore Mirror\n“The ‘Kissing Flies’ EP is conceptually more interesting that its predecessor, and the entire band’s hard work has really come good.”\n – Headbangers India"

We spend hours and hours in creating music, and only stop when we are completely satisfied with what we have made. When we hit the stage, though, we are all about having fun and entertaining the audience.\n\nWe released our 5 track debut EP \"Inmate\" in January 2014 which was received extremely well. Inmate was recorded with Arun Iyer from Mumbai-based thrash metal band Devoid. We also opened for Swedish band NALE in Gandhinagar (Gujarat) for Ragnarock 2013 at DA-IICT College, entertaining an audience of approximately 3000 people. Our most recent show was the Entombed Metal Festival in Mumbai, which was headlined by legendary Japanesh death metallers Defiled."

The band was formed by Ulhas, Bruce and Frank and later joined in by Mayank and Shezan. They started generating a good following by playing live in a lot of college events and competitions. They formed the band with one single vision in mind, to play extreme death metal music. In 2007 Shezan and Frank left the band, one citing musical differences and the other being busy with his other band. During this time Vincent \"The Beast\" Periera joined them on bass, and the band started playing club / pub events.\n\nOn 22nd Oct-07, Vince passed away cause of a severe asthma attack. It was a major blow to the band. The song ‘Visions Of The Dead’ was changed by Bruce over to ‘Visions Of The Beast’ as a tribute to Vince. Frank came back on the bass for few shows as the band was unable to find a stable bassist at the time, and played some major events in the Mumbai metal circuit.\n\nThe search for a permanent bassist was finally over in a couple of months, when Orenstein joined in the band. His first show with the band happened to be on his 20th birthday. Due to the constant line up changes, the band had never gotten the chance to perform outside the city of Mumbai. This changed from the mid of the year 2008 onwards; shows in Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore etc. were played by the band with some of the best bands from the country. Headlined few college events in Mumbai as well.\n\nIn the end of 2008 the band hit studios and recorded a couple of demos which was supposed to be released as an EP in 2009; but the band were unsatisfied with the quality of the recordings and decided to hold on to the release and wait for a better recordings. The band later on decided that they will release an album instead.\n\nIn the mid of 2010, Ulhas cause of personal and professional issues had to leave the band. Vocal duties in the band from that point onwards are being handled by Bruce who is also the main composer of the music. After a lot of line up changes the band has finally settled down on the current line up. Their songs talk about social evils, corruption, rape, injustice, pollution and environmental degradation and the compositions are influenced by old school, groove and progressive death metal sounds.\n\nThe band has made a mark in the local metal scene and are roaring for more gigs and shows across the country.\n\nAtmosfear is planning to record and release an album soon watchout for the same!!"

    "details": "Right from its inception in March 2000 Demonic Resurrection has been raising eyebrows.\n\nStarting out as bunch of 17-year-olds looking to give India a taste of extreme metal, then a nearly untouched genre, the band, spearheaded by Sahil ‘The Demonstealer’ Makhija, released their first album Demonstealer within nine months of formation. It was an amateurish first attempt but a bold step in a scene dominated by tribute and cover bands that got Demonic Resurrection noticed. As with most bands, teething problems meant that members came and went, and the first stable lineup came together only in 2001 with Demonstealer on vocals and guitars, Count Varathora on bass, Nikita Shah on vocals and keyboards and Yash Pathak on the drums. The band re-recorded Demonstealer with the current lineup. Though a marked improvement on the original recording, the band was still experimenting with its sound and recording, something that comes across clearly on the album. It was still amateurish but it received a fair bit of acclaim and Brazilian record label Vampiria Records released a tape version of the album in the local market. (Today though, copies of this album are collectors’ items.)\n\nHowever in 2002, the band fell apart, leaving the Demonstealer to build it back up from scratch. Resurrected in 2003 with a brand new-lineup, Demonic Resurrection was now Husain Bandukwala (bass), Mephisto (keyboards), JP (drums) and the Demonstealer (vocals, guitars). The band spent the next two years writing new material that reflected the change in lineup and each band member brought a different flavour to the music. Gone was the gothic/black/death metal sound of the band to now be replaced by a meld of equal parts melody and brutal aggression, the sound of their second album A Darkness Descends. The album was released in October 2005 to critical acclaim from all over the world (popular metal webzine Metal Observer rated it a 9 on 10) and till today is a benchmark release in the history of Indian metal. The album also gave birth to Demonstealer Records, an independent extreme metal record label launched by the Demonstealer, which would go on to release albums of all the top Indian metal bands. Looking to add yet more depth and dimension to their sound, the band enlisted lead guitarist Pradeep Pande in 2006 but the same year also saw the exit of drummer JP. This however didn’t stop DR from getting into the studio and recording their EP and third studio effort Beyond The Darkness, which featured on a split CD titled Rise Of The Eastern Blood along with bands Dusk from Pakistan and Severe Dementia from Bangladesh. Since the band had no drummer, Demonstealer took up the drum duties for the EP. Beyond the Darkness saw a slightly more experimental side of the band, adding ambience and spacey, ethereal textures to their sound. And while some fans were skeptical of the musical direction the band had taken, critics applauded it, heaping praise on the band.\n\nThat Indian metal and Demonic Resurrection in particular were on their way to global recognition became amply clear when filmmaker Sam Dunn (Metal: A Headbanger’s Journey, Iron Maiden: Flight 666) featured the band in his landmark documentary Global Metal. Demonic Resurrection was also the only Indian band to make it to the soundtrack of Global Metal along with the likes of Lamb of God, Sepultura and In Flames.\n\nThe band meanwhile continued to hunt for a new drummer until August 2007 when Virendra ‘Viru’ Kaith joined the band. Over the next year or so the band continued touring and writing new material till Pradeep quit in 2008 and was replaced by guitar prodigy Daniel Rego who was just 18 years old. 2009 saw the band widen the scope of their tours across India, going places that no Indian metal band had gone before and featuring as the support acts for Opeth in February 2009 and for Amon Amarth and Textures in December 2009.\n\nThe band hit the studio in August 2009 to record their third full-length album and what was to be the final chapter in the Darkness trilogy: The Return to Darkness. Roping in renowned artist Michael ‘Xaay’ Lorac (Nile, Karl Sanders, Behemoth, Vader) to design the artwork for the album, the band also released their first video for ‘The Unrelenting Surge of Vengeance’ that received (and continues to receive) airplay from mainstream music channels like VH1. The album was officially released in January 2010 followed by a nationwide tour ¬¬– The Resurrection Festival. The band capped 10 successful years of metal with their first international show at the prestigious Inferno Festival in Norway in April 2010 and and followed it up with appearance at the Brutal Assault festival in the Czech Republic in August 2010. The band also picked up the Metal Hammer Golden God Award for Global Metal in June 2010.\n\n\nIt’s been a long and sometimes arduous 10-year journey for the band – a story of struggle, brickbats, bottles, adulation and acceptance but most of all of incredible amounts hard work, determination and perseverance – and even naysayers will be hard-put to argue that DR are one of the most important bands to have come out of the Indian music scene. But yet, for Demonic Resurrection, the journey is only beginning…"

    "details": "Aggressive. Angry. Fierce. Downright thrash metal.\n\nFormed in a decade when heavy metal was still in its infant stages in India, Devoid has grown to become veteran death/thrash metallers representing a genre which was long under represented in the country.\n\nFormed in 2005, the band then comprised of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Arun Iyer, drummer Shubham Kumar and the lead guitarist Keshav Kumar. The three member group would meet Frank Pawar in 2006, which would be the line up for the larger part of the bands career. The band called ample attention on to itself by winning Campus Rock Idols which was one of the biggest competitions for rock and metal bands at that point in time, with in the first year of being together. With the fan base steadily increasing Devoid started touring with several indigenous acts in the scene like Demonic Resurrection, Bhayanak Maut, Myndsnare, Kryptos, Brute Force, Infernal Wrath etc. playing cities Pune, Hyderabad, Delhi, Shillong and home ground- Bombay. It wasn’t too long before the band moved from opening slots to headlining slots.\n\nIn 2010, Devoid reached one of its biggest and most crucial milestones in the band’s career when they released their debut ‘A God’s Lie’ through Demonstealer Records. The band toured Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune along side death/thrash metal troupers Nervecell from UAE. In the years to follow Devoid went on to share the stage with Cradle of Filth, Decapitated and Sybreed when the bands toured India. The band received rave reviews for the album all across, with one reviewer who went as far as to say that “A God’s Lie is a thrash metal fan’s wet dream come true”.\n\nPost A God’s Lie, Devoid encountered two more vital milestones when the band reinvented itself with a new line up. In 2011, Sanju Aguiar who filled in for Keshav Kumar while he was in UK joined the band on a full time basis. In 2012 the band saw another line up change with the departure of bass guitarist Frank Pawar whose place was then filled in by Abhishek Kamdar.\n\nThe band that has always carried anti-establishment has the central lyrical theme is currently plotting its sophomore release, which would be a concept album. Devoid has, and always will be- Downright Thrash Metal."

    "details": "Dionysian was started in the mid September of 2010, although having different music interests the band managed to be together and work out on its originals. After a short struggle in understanding the way of composing, Dionysian came up with the very 1st song 'Rapid Eye Movement' which gave boost to the bands in performance & composing other songs.\n\nIn the beginning Dionysian jammed with few fellow musicians and tried to comprehend different styles of playing music which consisted of covering songs from the bands like System Of A Down, Slipknot, etc., after covering these songs the band improved their composing skills and developed a mutual understanding among each other,gradually shelling in their own talent for the originals. After months of practice and dedicating more time towards music the band came up with two originals \"Ink of Misery\" & \"Delayed fatalities\" which the band performed at the first gig finale at High Voltage 2010, Ruia College, Matunga. The gig gave a boost to the bands stage presence,so massive tht the members worked more on the originals rather than covering other artists. Now, musically the band wanted to take risks in composing something different from the past experiences and after being highly influenced by different artists like Textures, Meshuggah, Gojira, Periphery, Whitechapel, Born of Osiris, Lamb of God, and particularly bands like Blind Image & Sky Harbor from the Indian scene,things were about to change.\n\nThe band later decided to add another front man in the project and so they introduced Nikhil Lokhande as another guitarist mainly influenced by genres like black/death metal. After having Nikhil the band came with another original \"METAMORPHOSIS\". The band introduced the new front man at Powerchords 2011, SIES college (Sion) & Channel [V] Launch Pad 2011,followed by a staunch winning performance at Drop D, (Somaiya College) Soon,with the madman's setlist and the urge to break into the scene,the band made it through the elims at b69 and got a chance to play at Springfest 2012, IIT Kharagpur alongside Grimmortal and Anthracite with all the successful gigs, winning crowds heart and with all good experiences Dionysian also performed for Wacken Metal Fest, Germany (B69) along side with Zygnema & Providence. \n\nShortly afterwards,our front man Nikhil Lokhande had to take a break from the band due to his will to study overseas,the position was immediately filled by the former guitarist Noel Michael,and since then the line up remains constant and known to the masses.\n\nNow Dionysian continues to play as a 5 piece metalcore band and continues to focus its music into a different direction, so far the band has managed to win stages and the crowds heart. With the abstract music being made,the prospects of the band is on sheer will power and the dedication.With the influential love for music.Even relentlessly working on the desired soulful music plus proving it onstage has been a prime attribute for the Dionysian."

    "details": "Part of the New Wave of Indian Extreme Metal, GRiMMoRTaL is a metal band from Navi Mumbai formed in the summer of 2009 which plays a heavily down-tuned, groovy and technical but melodic style of music, basically combining the band members' various influences ranging from Death Metal, Grindcore, Brutal Slam & Progressive Metalcore.\n\nIt started when Joy (Guitars), Deep (Vocals) and Prateek (Bass) felt the need to play some heavy metal. They found a drummer in Saurav who had to leave a year later due to musical differences. The search for a good metal drummer finally led Joy switching onto Drums. Vivek (Guitars) and Rahul (Vocals) who were close friends of the band joined in and the new line-up started playing live. They were accompanied by Nikant & Elvis (Guitars) along with Emmanuel (Drums) helping out live. After the half-year long Execrating Normality Tour in 2013, GRiMMoRTaL welcomes Abhishek (Vocals), Neeraj (Guitars) and Amogh (Drums) who've been a part 2014 onwards.\n\nAfter successful major gigs in BITS Pilani, Kolkata and various gigs in and around their hometown, in March 2012 they shared stage with Grindcore legends NAPALM DEATH (U.K.) and Arsames (Iran) in Kathmandu, Nepal as a part of Metal Mayhem IV. This was a milestone for the band.\n\nLyrically, the themes are as diverse as motivating ourselves about not laying low and emotionally depressed without necessity (Why So Emo?) to releasing the rage and hatred in a constructive way (Burn In Peace). From somehow digesting the happenings of the corrupt and unfair (Resistance) to speaking about the chaotic and unstable mental state that is the result of years of pain and suffering (Tormented). The latest track talks about the thoughts of complete eradication of humankind as the phrase goes 'kill or be killed' (Fatality). Newer additions to the set-list include the songs Abomination, Pantomime & Refrag all of which can be found in the band's debut full-length album, Execrating Normality."

    "details": "Reptilian Death came into existence in May 2001 as a solo project of the Demonstealer (Of Demonic Resurrection fame).The project was meant to be a grindcore/death metal project. At the end of May 2001 Reptilian Death released its 1st recording which was a collection of 5 songs called \"5 Easy Ways To Murder Someone\" with each song representing a different method of murder. The songs were a mix of death metal and grindcore but contained the unusual element of humor which gave the whole concept a sort of spoof feel. After this release the project took a back seat until November 2001 which was when Reptilian Death turned from a solo project into a full fledged band after Husain joined as the bassist and Jaivir joined as guitarist and The Demonstealer took over drums and vocal duties. The band prepared itself with 2 new songs \"No Way To Die\" and \"The 2nd Coming Of Evil\" and traveled to Bangalore City to play its 1st live show at The National Law Schools event \"Strawberry Fields\". Sadly the show never happened and Reptilian Death ended up doing an acoustic death metal set at Planet M due to distortion not being allowed.\n\nThe band returned to Bombay and did their 1st proper gig at Razzberry Rhino. The bands high energy act and intensity got them a good response from people. Following which they recruited a 2nd guitar player, Girish Menon. The band continued touring the local college and club circuit and even bagged a best drummer and bass bassist at a local competition, which was unusual for a metal band to do.\n\nAfter the bands gig at the RAIT College festival in 2003 the band more or less stopped playing live as the band members were busy with other commitments. In July 2003 The Demonstealer decided to continue the project solo once again and followed up the earlier \"5 Easy Ways To Murder Someone\" with another concept song called \"Nursery Rhymes For Satan’s Children\" as well as recording the bands 5 originally composed songs and planed to release an album in August 2003.Things however did not go as planned and the album got postponed indefinitely.\n\nThe Demonstealer then bought the band back together for IIT's Livewire show, where\n\nSunny (Epithap) replaced Jaivir on guitars and Nitin (Morticide) took over the main vocal duties. This is was a one off gig for the band and happened to be the last for Girish who passed away in Febuary 2004 after which the band pretty much stopped existing, but Demonstealer did go ahead and release the much awaited album titled ‘Total Annihilation’ in July 2004.\n\nAfter 2 years RD was resurrected for a briefly during the end of 2005 for 2 gigs where Pradeep (Demonic Resurrection) handling guitars and new member Sugath doing vocals. Following this the Demonstealer once again flew solo and wrote a new RD EP titled ‘Intestinal Feast’ where he handled all the music and Sugath featured as the vocalist and lyricist. The EP was released in late 2006 on a split CD called ‘Defaced and Split’ on Demonstealer Records. Following which the band started touring again with new guitarist Arjun, Husain (Bass), Sugath (Vocals) and Demonstealer (Drums). The band toured for almost a year after which it went back into hibernation.\n\nSince 2008, Demonstealer has been writing new material and it seems that 2013 will see the resurrection of Reptilian Death."

The Rajbot was induced in November 2008 and in December 2008 the band started tickling everyone's funny bones at their live gigs which received huge praise from fans and even bystanders.\n\nWorkshop launched their 1st video Cookie Monster on 19th March 2009, exactly a year after transforming into Workshop and starting writing their debut effort.\n\nMay 2009 saw the release of the Khooni Murga CD + DVD combo, the 1st for any India band and the album created waves across the country.\n\nShortly after the Murga was set free the band spent the next two years touring across the country before settling down to write their follow up album during which both the Rajbot and Rijunator quit the band to get more serious. Replacing them were The Devestator and The Kadominator and with all their powers combined the album 'Made Love To The Dragon' was written.\n\nShortly after the album The Devestator rejected the program and was filled in by a Kenneth Water Purifier. Still no water though."
